<p>(3) The rights and fundamental freedoms in the Bill of Rights&mdash;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>belong to each individual and are not granted by the State;</li>

<li>&nbsp;the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights.</li>
</ol>
<p>(5) In applying any right under Article 43, if the State claims that it does not have the resources to implement the right, a court, tribunal or other authority shall be guided by the following principles&mdash;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>&nbsp;it is the responsibility of the State to show that the resources are not available;</li>
<li>&nbsp;in allocating resources, the State shall give priority to ensuring the widest possible enjoyment of the right or fundamental freedom having regard to prevailing circumstances, including the vulnerability of particular groups or individuals; and</li>
<li>&nbsp;the court, tribunal or other authority may not interfere with a decision by a State organ concerning the allocation of available resources, solely on the basis that it would have reached a different conclusion.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Implementation of rights and fundamental freedoms.</h3>

<li>&nbsp;a person acting as a member of, or in the interest of, a group or class of persons;</li>

<li>&nbsp;an association acting in the interest of one or more of its members.</li>
</ol>
<p>(3) The Chief Justice shall make rules providing for the court proceedings referred to in this Article, which shall satisfy the criteria that&mdash;</p>

<li>&nbsp;the rights of standing provided for in clause (2) are fully facilitated;</li>
<li>&nbsp;formalities relating to the proceedings, including commencement of the proceedings, are kept to the minimum, and in particular that the court shall, if necessary, entertain proceedings on the basis of informal documentation;</li>

<li>&nbsp;the court, while observing the rules of natural justice, shall not be unreasonably restricted by procedural technicalities; and</li>
<li>&nbsp;an organisation or individual with particular expertise may, with the leave of the court, appear as a friend of the court.</li>

<p>(4) The absence of rules contemplated in clause (3) does not limit the right of any person to commence court proceedings under&nbsp;this Article, and to have the matter heard and determined by a court.</p>
<h3>Authority of courts to uphold and enforce the Bill of Rights.</h3>

</ol>
<p>(2) Despite clause (1), a provision in legislation limiting a right or fundamental freedom&mdash;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>&nbsp;in the case of a provision enacted or amended on or after the effective date, is not valid unless the legislation specifically expresses the intention to limit that right or fundamental freedom, and the nature and extent of the limitation;</li>
<li>&nbsp;shall not be construed as limiting the right or fundamental freedom unless the provision is clear and specific about the right or freedom to be limited and the nature and extent of the limitation; and</li>
<li>&nbsp;shall not limit the right or fundamental freedom so far as to derogate from its core or essential content.</li>
</ol>
<p>(3) The State or a person seeking to justify a particular limitation shall demonstrate to the court, tribunal or other authority that the requirements of this Article have been satisfied.</p>
